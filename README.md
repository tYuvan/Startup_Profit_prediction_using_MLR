Startup profit prediction using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) aims to estimate a startup’s profit based on multiple business factors.
MLR analyzes how variables like R&D spending, marketing cost, and administration expenses together influence profit.
By learning patterns from historical data, the model provides more accurate and realistic predictions than single-factor models.
This helps startups make better financial decisions and optimize resource allocation.
MLR is widely used for multi-domain business forecasting in machine learning.
